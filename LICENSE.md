## Privacy and Cookies
### PRIVACY SUMMARY
None of our products record or sell your personal identifying information. All personal information is stored on-device for personalization purposes only. The only things sent to our backends are anonymous data like analytics and user-inputted usernames and configuration.

### LEADERBOARDS
Our leaderboards are stored through LootLocker. Anything you enter as your name can and most likely will be displayed on the public leaderboard. We do our best to censor offensive language. That being said, it is all user-added data and we don't take responsibity for any harm leaderboard names may cause. If you see a name and want to report it, let us know at bugs@jcwyt.com.

### ANALYTICS
We take analytic data on most of our websites through Google Analytics, which includes city and device information. That information IS NOT tied to your IP or name.
